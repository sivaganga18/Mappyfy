See built-in `Modal` renderer (to display popups) for example. *Call for PRs!* let's build some custom renderers for ActionSheet, Drawer, etc. Let's make an awesome library! Currently, if you want to use Action Sheets you'll need to use a 3rd party module.\n\n- **Dynamic Routing** allows you to choose which scene to render depending on application state (see the `Switch` renderer, useful for authentication).\n\n- **Bring Your Own Reducer** for navigation state.\n\n- **Reset History Stack** - The new [`reset`](docs/API_CONFIGURATION.md#scene)type for clearing the history stack and eliminating the navbar back button.\n\n- **More Powerful State Control** - Support for having different states while on the same screen. For example, \"View My Account\" could allow in-place editing of fields and \"Save\", \"Cancel\" navigation bar buttons should appear.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCheck out the [mini-tutorial](docs/MINI_TUTORIAL.md) for a quick walkthrough of the routing system.\n\n## Supported configurations\n\nWhile ExperimentalNavigation API is not stable, RNRF uses separated fork of ExperimentalNavigation API to avoid dependency from React Native version.\nSo 3.30 version of RNRF doesn't depend from React Native version, but from that fork (now it is based on 0.26 API).\nYou could use this component with RN0.26+\n\n## Installation\n```\nnpm i react-native-router-flux --save\n```\n\n## Usage\nIn your top-level `index.js`, define your scenes using the `Scene` component and pass it into the `Router` as children:\n```js\nimport {Scene, Router} from 'react-native-router-flux';\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <Router>\n      <Scene key=\"root\">\n        <Scene key=\"login\" component={Login} title=\"Login\"/>\n        <Scene key=\"register\" component={Register} title=\"Register\"/>\n        <Scene key=\"home\" component={Home}/>\n      </Scene>\n    </Router>\n  }\n}\n```\nAlternatively, you could define all of your scenes during compile time and use it later within `Router`:\n```js\nimport {Actions, Scene, Router} from 'react-native-router-flux';\n\nconst scenes = Actions.create(\n  <Scene key=\"root\">\n    <Scene key=\"login\" component={Login} title=\"Login\"/>\n    <Scene key=\"register\" component={Register} title=\"Register\"/>\n    <Scene key=\"home\" component={Home}/>\n  </Scene>\n);\n\n/* ... */\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <Router scenes={scenes}/>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn any Scene, you can also call the following functions by first importing the `Actions` object:\n```js\nimport {Actions} from 'react-native-router-flux'\n```\nAnd then:\n\n* `Actions.ACTION_NAME(PARAMS)` will call the appropriate action and params will be passed to the scene.\n* `Actions.pop()` will pop the current screen. It accepts following optional params:\n  * `{popNum: [number]}` allows to pop multiple screens at once\n  * `{refresh: {...propsToSetOnPreviousScene}}` allows to refresh the props of the scene that it pops back to\n* `Actions.refresh(PARAMS)` will update the properties of the current screen.\n\n## Production Apps using react-native-router-flux\n+ Buddify ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1149011372), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buddify)) - helps travelers discover fun things to do locally.\n+ GuavaPass.com ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/guavapass-one-pass-fitness/id1050491044?l=en&mt=8), Android) - offers convenient access to top classes at boutique fitness studios across Asia.\n+ Epic Fail Videos ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epic-fail-videos-best-fail/id1115219339), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hazuu.epicfailvideos)) - The best Fail Videos Collection, never miss a laugh with your friends!\n+ Junk Free ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/junk-free-by-junk-free-june/id1109940159)) - A simple way to find, share, and save recipes, workouts, and other healthy content with your friends, family and workmates.\n+ chozun ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/chozun/id1097365167), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chozun)) - Your travel companion, matching your lifestyle on the go!\n+ Snappatizer ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snappatizer-find-rank-best/id1147400405?mt=8)) - Find and rank the best food around you.\n+ Look Lock ([GitHub](https://github.com/7kfpun/PhotosReactNative), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/look-lock-show-photos-without/id1151863742), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kfpun.photos)) - Show photos without worries.\n+ BusDue, ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/busdue/id1185327843?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.busdue)) - London bus arrival time app\n\n## Support\nThanks to all who submitted PRs to 2.x release.
